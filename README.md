That's a demo of the scala support of [hawkeyesec's scanner-cli](https://github.com/hawkeyesec/scanner-cli).

This demo uses sbt-native-packager universal package to build the app. If you're using sbt-assembly, check
[this branch](https://github.com/csokol/scala-hawkeyesec-scanner-demo/tree/sbt-assembly). 

To run the scanner:

```bash
sbt clean universal:packageBin
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/target hawkeyesec/scanner-cli
```

Then you should see some offenses generated by find-sec-bugs and a few more by java-owasp.

Notice that, with this setup, find-sec-bugs won't scan the dependencies of the project. If you want to have the 
dependencies scanned you can add `retrieveManaged := true` to the `build.sbt` so that the jars are copied locally
during the build.

That's a demo of the scala support of [hawkeyesec's scanner-cli](https://github.com/hawkeyesec/scanner-cli).

To run the scanner:

```bash
sbt clean package
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/target hawkeyesec/scanner-cli
```

Then you should see some offenses generated by find-sec-bugs (found in the scala code but also on the http components 
library) and a few more by java-owasp.
